# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

### Project Overview
This project develops a robust time series forecasting model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence prediction. The goal is to accurately forecast a future trend based on historical data. This project goes beyond a basic implementation by incorporating data preprocessing and feature engineering, which are crucial for real-world time series problems.

### Dataset
The model is trained on a synthetic time series dataset representing a typical financial or economic trend. The data includes a single variable over time, but the code is structured to easily handle additional features for a more complex forecasting task.

### Methodology
1.  **Data Generation and Preprocessing:** A synthetic time series dataset is created to simulate a realistic trend. The data is then normalized using a `MinMaxScaler` to improve model stability and performance.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** The time series is transformed into a supervised learning problem by creating sequences of past data points to predict a future value.
3.  **LSTM Model Architecture:** A sequential model with one or more LSTM layers is designed to learn from the sequential data. The model is compiled with an `Adam` optimizer and a mean squared error loss function.
4.  **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained and its performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The predictions are visualized against the actual data to assess the model's accuracy.

### Concluded Results
The LSTM model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, accurately capturing the underlying trends and patterns in the time series data. The model's predictions closely align with the actual values, which is validated by a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set. This project highlights proficiency in time series analysis, LSTM network design, and data preparation for sequential models.
